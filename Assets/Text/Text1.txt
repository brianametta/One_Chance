You wake up from a strange dream in the hospital. 
You wonder how you got here, and why. 
You feel cold and numb and notice a tag around your big toe. 
Your body is covered in bruises and lesions.
Suddenly you notice that you  are looking at your body from outside yourself. 
Your body is in the basement of the hospital lined up with other expired patients on cold steel beds. 
You notice other people who are outside of their bodies, mourning themselves.
"How can I be dead, what happened?" You think to yourself.
"Come on Archer, try and think."
You finally remember that last night you had a drunken episode and you were fighting with your girlfriend Eva. 
She had been trying to help you with your drinking problem but your shame turned into rage, and you ended up getting behind the wheel.
Suddenly, you feel the entirety your being tingling, and things go black. 
You feel yourself falling...
